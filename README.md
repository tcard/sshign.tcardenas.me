<p>Sign, verify and encrypt using publicly available SSH keys, right in your browser!</p>

<p>While GPG isn't that common, and is a pain, everybody with a GitHub account should have a SSH key. This program makes it easy to sign things with it.</p>

<p>Note that <strong>no server</strong> is involved, except for optionally fetching public keys from GitHub; everything happens in your browser.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I'm not a crypto expert. This program hasn't been audited. No guarantees.</p>
